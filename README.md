# Hi, I'm Vasanth Nayak

I'm a **generalist software engineer** who works across **Web Development**, **Embedded Systems** or **Systems Programming**.  
I enjoy building real, end-to-end projects that help me understand how software and hardware actually work together.

My goal is to write clean, reliable code, understand fundamentals deeply, and build engineering range across multiple domains.

## What I Work On
- Frontend Engineering (React, Vue, TypeScript,Javascript)
- Embedded Systems (STM32, HAL, FreeRTOS)
- Protocol Implementation & Parsing (wM-Bus, AES-128 CBC, OpenSSL)
- Systems Programming (C, C++, Linux)
- IoT, Device Interfaces & Firmware Logic

## Skills & Tools

**Languages:** C, C++, TypeScript, JavaScript  
**Platforms:** STM32, Ubuntu/Linux  
**Protocols / Interfaces:** UART, I2C, SPI, PWM, GPIO  
**Libraries / Frameworks:** OpenSSL, HAL, FreeRTOS, React, Vue  
**Tools:** STM32CubeIDE, Logic Analyzer, Git, GCC/G++, GDB, Serial Monitor  
**Special Interests:** Embedded security, protocol parsing, RTOS architecture, clean frontend engineering

## What I'm Learning Right Now
- Bare-metal specifics  
- Porting FreeRTOS into MCU
- ADA lang  

---

## How I Work
- I write code that my future self can understand.  
- I prefer clean, modular functions over clever hacks.  
- I break problems down into small, testable components.  
- I treat side projects like real projects (docs, structure, clarity).
